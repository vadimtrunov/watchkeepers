# TASK File Template

Every `rdd` run creates exactly one `TASK-<roadmap-id>-<slug>.md` file in the
repo root at the start of Phase 2. The file is gitignored (`TASK-*.md` in
`.gitignore`) and deleted at the end of Phase 7.

## Filename

Pattern: `TASK-<roadmap-id>-<slug>.md`

- `<roadmap-id>` — e.g. `M1.1`, `M3`, `M1.9.a`. Dots kept.
- `<slug>` — kebab-case, from the sub-item title, max 40 chars.

Examples:

- `TASK-M1.1-monorepo-layout.md`
- `TASK-M1.9-ci-pipeline.md`
- `TASK-M2-keep-storage.md`

## Template (exact content to write)

```markdown
# TASK <roadmap-id> — <title>

**ROADMAP**: docs/ROADMAP-<phase>.md §M# → <roadmap-id>
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: in-progress
**Branch**: rdd/<slug>
**PR**: <empty until Phase 5>

## Scope

<one paragraph: what is included and what is explicitly NOT included>

## Acceptance criteria (approved at Gate 2)

- [ ] AC1: <criterion>
- [ ] AC2: <criterion>

## Test plan (approved at Gate 2)

- [ ] Happy: <case>
- [ ] Edge: <case>
- [ ] Negative: <case>
- [ ] Security / isolation: <case>

## Plan (implementation steps)

- [ ] Step 1 — <action>
- [ ] Step 2 — <action>

## Progress log

<!-- append-only, one entry per phase transition -->

## Follow-up (nits deferred from review)

<!-- empty at start; review loop appends here -->
```

## Status transitions

- `in-progress` — created at Phase 2, active through Phase 6.
- `blocked` — set by the orchestrator when a phase escalates and the operator
  chooses `continue` to investigate without moving on.
- `merged` — **transient runtime marker**: set right before deletion at
  Phase 7 step 6. Because `TASK-*.md` is gitignored, this status is almost
  never present in git history — it exists only in the in-memory view of
  the orchestrator for the brief window between `writer` returning and the
  file being deleted. Do not rely on seeing `merged` after a run completes.
- `cancelled` — set when the operator chooses `abort` on an escalation or
  rejects at Gate 3.

For practical resume purposes, only `in-progress` and `blocked` matter.

## Progress log entries

Each entry is one Markdown heading + a short paragraph. Written by the
orchestrator, not by agents, at each phase transition.

Example:

```markdown
### 2026-04-22 14:32 — Phase 2 complete, Gate 2 passed

Acceptance criteria: 3. Test plan: 5 cases. Ready for Phase 3.

### 2026-04-22 15:10 — Phase 3 complete

executor dispatched: opus. Commits: 4 (c1b2d3e…ffeebb7). Files: 9.

### 2026-04-22 15:24 — Phase 4 iteration 1

code-reviewer: 0 blocker, 2 important, 3 nit. Dispatching fixer.

### 2026-04-22 15:31 — Phase 4 converged

2 important resolved in 1 fix iteration. 3 nits moved to Follow-up.
```

## Field precision

- `**ROADMAP**` line includes the `§` symbol and the full id path; if the
  item was decomposed, use the leaf id (e.g. `§M1 → M1.9 → M1.9.a`).
- `**Status**` must be exactly one of `in-progress`, `blocked`, `cancelled`,
  `merged`.
- `**Branch**` is set at Phase 3; empty between Phase 2 creation and Phase 3
  checkout.
- `**PR**` is set at Phase 5 (PR URL from `gh pr create`); empty before.
